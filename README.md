# Bring the code to the data for Galaxy experiments

Proof of concept code to test out on galaxyproject postgresql databases - run locally and check outputs to avoid privacy concerns

These will run happily in jupyter notebooks!

galumds.py is ready to try - it should produce a pdf of all users in tool space - expect lots of clusters - BoF to be explored.

plotusermds.py was the development code with a fake data generator to test since I only have tiny job tables...

Please let me see any outputs :)
